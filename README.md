✅ All done with LLMs, web scraping, and vector search under the hood.

## 🧠 Powered By

- ⚙️ **LangChain** + **ChromaDB** – for text chunking and retrieval
- ⚡ **Groq LLMs** – ultra-fast inference with Llama 3.3 + Llama Guard
- 🧾 **Gradio** – interactive and clean frontend
- 🧠 **Sentence Transformers** – HuggingFace `all-mpnet-base-v2` embeddings

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Enter your **Groq API key** (free from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys))
2. Paste a valid website link
3. Get a **summary of the page**
4. Ask **any question** — it answers from the actual page content

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Works best on clean, informational content (blogs, docs, articles)
- Avoid links behind login/auth
- LLMs may occasionally hallucinate — accuracy improves with clearer queries

---

## 🔐 Safety Check

All user queries are passed through **Llama Guard 4** (Groq) for toxicity and harmful intent.
